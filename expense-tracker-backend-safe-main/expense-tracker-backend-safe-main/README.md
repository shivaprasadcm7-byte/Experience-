# Expense Tracker Backend (SAFE STARTER)

## Purpose
This backend is intentionally created WITHOUT MongoDB connection initially.
It allows you to:
- Verify Node + Express setup
- Verify routes work
- Avoid MongoDB errors initially

## Steps to Run
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5000

You should see:
{ "status": "Backend running successfully" }

## Next Step
After confirming everything works, MongoDB + Auth logic will be added.
